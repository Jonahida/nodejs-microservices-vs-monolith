# react-microservices-vs-monolith

This repository features two Python applications: one using a microservices architecture and the other a monolithic architecture. It aims to compare their performance through load testing and metrics analysis. A dashboard is included to visualize results, helping to evaluate how each architecture manages scaling and response to concurrent requests.
